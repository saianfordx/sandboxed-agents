RAG Application Test Document

This is a test document for our Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) application. 

The application uses the following technologies:
- Next.js for the web framework
- LangChain v0.3+ for AI orchestration
- Pinecone for vector storage
- OpenAI for embeddings and language models

Key Features:
1. Document Upload: Users can upload PDF and TXT files
2. Text Processing: Documents are automatically chunked and embedded
3. Vector Search: Semantic search using Pinecone vector database
4. AI Chat: Conversational interface powered by LangChain

This document will be processed into chunks, embedded using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large model, and stored in Pinecone for retrieval during conversations.

The system follows modern RAG patterns with tool-calling capabilities and proper error handling throughout the pipeline.
